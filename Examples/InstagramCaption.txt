February 2, 1653

🍎 On this day the city of New Amsterdam was born, i.e. today's New York.

🗺️ New Amsterdam was a 17th century fortified village, part of the Dutch colony of New Netherlands, a village that would later become the city of New York.

🚢 The city was located in a strategic point, on the southern tip of Manhattan island, and was created with the intention of allowing the companies that managed the fur trade in the Hudson River valley to defend river access.
